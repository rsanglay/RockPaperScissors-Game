# RockPaperScissors-Game

The user's input function should use an if loop to ensure that the input is valid (rock, paper, or scissors).

The computer's input function can use the random module to generate a random choice between rock, paper, and scissors.

The game logic function should compare the user's input and the computer's input using if loops to determine the winner.

The game can then be played by calling these functions and printing the results.
